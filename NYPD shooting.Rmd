## Introduction
- This R Markdown document is submitted as the final project for DSTA 5301.
- This assignment includes 6 parts:
    1. **Import section** - import data from a website
    2. **Tidy section** - basic tidiness
    3. **Transform section** - add additional data needed for analysis
    4. **Analyze section** - analyze 2 different aspects of the data and present as visuals
    5. **Model section** - predict a linear model and compare to real world data
    6. **Conclusions and Bias** - Summarize findings and describe bias

The scope of this work is the analysis of the shooting incidents reported by NYPD, between 2006-2023.
Two visualizations and one model will analyzed as part of the requirements for this assignment. 

- The objective of this work:
  1. Analyze shooting incidents by borough.
  2. Analyze the shooting incidents rate in 2 boroughs which encountered the most shooting incidents.
  3. Analyze the shooting hour trend.
  4. Define a model, which will be used to predict shooting  incidents in a specific borough.

## Import data

* Following steps are performed in this step:
  1. Include libraries which are utilized in this report.
  2. Import data from a specified website.
  3. Replace empty cells and "null" cells with NA.
  
* I have reviewed the missing data to assess the potential impact on my analysis.\
  Since I will focus on the shooting incidents trend, the missing data will have minor effect on my analysis,\
  since the very few data cells which I will be using in my analysis are empty, compared to the overall data.

```{r import, echo=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)

# Load libraries used in this R Markdown document
# Suppress package start up messages
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(tidyverse)
  library(lubridate)
  library(dplyr) })


# Load data from website
url_in_NYPD <- "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/833y-fsy8/rows.csv"
NYPD_shooting <-read.csv(url_in_NYPD)

# Put NA to empty cells
NYPD_shooting[NYPD_shooting == ""] <- NA 
NYPD_shooting[NYPD_shooting == "(null)"] <- NA

```

## Tidy data
* Following steps are performed in this step:
  1. Remove unnecessary columns
  2. Add "incident" column, with a count of 1, since each row represent 1 incident
  3. Sort data set - from oldest to newest incident
  4. Present 5 rows of data set after basic cleaning - Table 1




```{r tidy_data, echo=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)

# Add incidents column, each row is one incident
NYPD_shooting <- NYPD_shooting %>%
  select(-c(LOC_OF_OCCUR_DESC:LOCATION_DESC)) %>%
  select(-c(X_COORD_CD:Lon_Lat)) %>%
  mutate(incidents=1) 
  
# Change date characters to date object
NYPD_shooting <- NYPD_shooting %>%
  mutate(OCCUR_DATE = mdy(OCCUR_DATE)) 
  

#Sort dataset according to date, starting from oldest incident to newest  
NYPD_shooting <- NYPD_shooting[order(as.Date(NYPD_shooting$OCCUR_DATE, format="%Y-%M-%D")),]

#Display the dataset - first 5 rows only
knitr::kable(NYPD_shooting %>% slice(1:5),  
           caption = "Table 1- Dataset after basic tidiness (first 5 rows are displayed) ") 

```

## Transform data
* Following steps are performed in this step:
  1. Summarize data according to the borough
  2. Present a summary table of incidents per borough


```{r transform, echo=TRUE}

# Add a column - counter_by_boro
NYPD_shooting <- NYPD_shooting %>%
  group_by(BORO) %>%
  mutate(counter_by_boro = seq_along(BORO)) %>%
  ungroup()


# Pivot according to the boro and incidents
shooting_by_boro <- NYPD_shooting %>%
  select(BORO, incidents) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from=incidents, values_from=incidents, values_fn= sum) %>%
  rename(Borough = 'BORO', Shooting_Incidents="1")

# Display table with summary of incidents by Borough
knitr::kable(shooting_by_boro,  
           caption = "Table 2 - Summary of incidents by Boroughs in NY, 2006-2023") 
```

According to table 2, Brooklyn and Bronx are the boroughs which had the most shooting incidents,
between 2006-2023.


## Analyze data
In this section, 2 trends will be analyzed.
Based on table 2, I will present the shooting incidents trend in Brooklyn and Bronx.\ 
Additionally - the shooting incidents per time of day in NY will be analyzed and displayed as a histogram.


```{r analyze, echo=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)


# Filter data according to Bronx and Brooklyn borough
NYPD_shooting_BRONX = NYPD_shooting %>% filter(BORO == "BRONX")
NYPD_shooting_BROOKYLYN = NYPD_shooting %>% filter(BORO == "BROOKLYN")


# Plot shooting incidents trend in Bronx and Brooklyn
ggplot() +
    geom_point(data = NYPD_shooting_BRONX, aes(x = OCCUR_DATE, y = counter_by_boro, color = "BRONX")) +
    geom_point(data = NYPD_shooting_BROOKYLYN, aes(x = OCCUR_DATE, y = counter_by_boro, color = "BROOKLYN")) +
    labs(title = "Figure 1 - Shooting Trends for Bronx and Brooklyn, 2006-2023",
        x = "Date",
        y = "Shooting Incidents",
        color = "Borough") +
    theme_minimal()

```

* Main conclusions:
  1. Brooklyn has higher shooting incidents rate than Bronx
  2. Between 2006 to 2020, shooting incidents rate declined gradually, and then increased from 2020 to 2023.


```{r analyze2, echo=TRUE}
#Shooting hours
NYPD_shooting_timestamp <- strptime(NYPD_shooting$OCCUR_TIME, format="%H:%M:%S")
#NYPD_shooting_hours <-  as.numeric(format(NYPD_shooYPting_timestamp, format="%H"))
NYPD_shooting <- NYPD_shooting %>% mutate(hour=NYPD_shooting_timestamp$hour)


#Present histogram of shooting hours
hist_data <- hist(NYPD_shooting$hour, breaks=seq(-1, 23),plot=FALSE, )


plot(hist_data, main ="Figure 2 - Shooting incidents per time of day in NY, 2006-2023", xlab="Hour (0-24)", ylab="Shooting incidents", col= "dodgerblue", labels = FALSE, ylim=c(0,2500), sub = "Note: Hour axis starts at 11pm" ) 

print("\n")
```

\
As seen in figure 2, the majority of the shooting incidents in NY between 2006-2023 occur between 10pm to 11pm.


## Model
In this section, a linear model will be defined to predict the shooting incidents trend in Bronx between 2006-2023.
In order to develop the linear model, the dates will converted to day count.
A comparison between the actual shooting incident trend in Bronx, will be compared to the linear model.

```{r model, echo=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)

# Add start date coulmn
NYPD_shooting_BRONX <- NYPD_shooting_BRONX %>% mutate(start_date=OCCUR_DATE[1])


# Add day num 
NYPD_shooting_BRONX <- NYPD_shooting_BRONX %>%
  mutate(day_num = as.numeric(difftime(OCCUR_DATE,start_date,units="days")))


# Define linear model
mod <- lm(NYPD_shooting_BRONX$counter_by_boro ~ NYPD_shooting_BRONX$day_num)
pred= predict(mod)

# Add the prediction of the model to the NYPD_Shooting_Bronx dataset
NYPD_shooting_BRONX <- NYPD_shooting_BRONX %>% mutate(pred= predict(mod))

# Plot Bronx shooting incidents trend and the linear model prediction
ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = NYPD_shooting_BRONX$day_num, y = NYPD_shooting_BRONX$counter_by_boro, color = "Actual")) +
  geom_line(aes(x = NYPD_shooting_BRONX$day_num, y = NYPD_shooting_BRONX$pred, color="Prediction")) +
  labs(title = "Figure 3 - Shooting incidents in Bronx,NY between 2006-2023 vs linear prediction model") + xlab(" Day count between 2006-2023") +  
  ylab("Shooting incidents") 

   
```
As seen in figure 3, the shooting trend in Bronx, between the year 2003-2026, has a linear behavior.
The model can be used to predict the number of shooting incidents in Bronx in the upcoming years.


## Conclusion and bias

### Conclusions

- The main conclusions of the analyses are:
  1. Brooklyn and Bronx encountered the most number of shooting incidents in NY, between 2006-2023.
  2. Compared to Bronx, Brooklyn has a higher shooting incidents rate.
  3. The hour which has the most shooting incidents in NY is 10pm to 11pm.
  3. The shooting incidents trend in Bronx, has a good fit to linear model.
  

### Bias

- My main bias in this work from the very beginning, was that my initial analysis was focused on boroughs.
Consequently, I analyzed the shooting incidents trend in Bronx and Brooklyn only.
Main mitigation strategy, is to draw conclusion which are specific to the borough and generalize it.

- Additional bias I had, is regarding the parameters that I selected to analyze - shooting incident trend and hour of shooting.
The scope of those parameters is limited and therefore, before drawing conclusions, additional parameters need to be analyzed.
